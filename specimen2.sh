#                 the specimen2 prompt:
#
#                 create a script that:
#
#               - determines the IP of the device it is running on 
#               - determines all subnet information: 
#                   - gateway
#                   - mask
#                   - broadcast
#                   - DNS server configuration -> need to add this
#                   - all other live hosts on subnet -> need to add this
#                   - current outbound connections -> need to add this
#               - organize this information into a clean file -> need to add this
#               - perform nslookup of google.com using 8.8.8.8 as a name server   -> need to add this
#               - write it all to a file on the desktop -> need to add this
#                           ^^ if written to the desktop, the file could be written anywhere. 
#                              the goal is to practice writing files to different directories without
#                              messing around in the more sensitive disk locations yet
