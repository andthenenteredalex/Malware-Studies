# Malware-Studies 2-23-2019

Often, malware is nothing more than a simple script, whether it be a shell script for Linux or Mac, or a Powershell script,
which is by far the most likely to have an impact on an enterprise because of the widespread use of the Windows OS.

The purpose of this project is to write my own scripts which use the same technqiques as malware. I want to dive deep into the 
details of how malware works by writing my own Bash, Powershell, and Python scripts that use the same techniques malware uses today. 
This includes scripts that try to understand the environment and make decisions based on this information, 
find the logged-in users, discover the network configuration, find and copy files, crack passwords, use encrypted payloads, 
encrypt data before transmission to the command and control server, and finally, exfiltration using tunneling techniques.

Each script will be run on a lab network not connected to the internet. 

Because I am a member of the Blue Team, I will be approaching this project from the defensive side. I'm going to record 
packet captures for all networking traffic and attempt to block it by using tools like snort, and then I will attempt to evade
detection, and the cycle will continue.

I welcome any input. This project is for two purposes: to learn and to have fun.

Thanks for your interest.
